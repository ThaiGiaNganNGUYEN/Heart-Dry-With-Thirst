# ComSSA Curtin 2025 Hackathon - Regrowth
**Heart-Dry-With-Thirst**
<ul> The Challenge: <br>
With the current state of the old water delivery systems, simply
replacing en masse all known infrastructure runs a high risk of
severely disrupting the water supply to an unknowable
population which could be connected to a particular system.

Traditional surveying methods have proven too cumbersome and
disruptive to accurately map the extent of the undocumented
network in India’s crowded cities, which has hindered attempts to
figure out how to replace the system without significant
disruption.

Your team has been contracted by the government of West
Bengal to provide a solution for a system to aid in the upgrading
of their water supply and delivery infrastructure. Its major cities
are its focus, but your solution should ideally be extensible to
rural farming regions, and replicable to other areas of the country.

<ul> Our Solution:
  <li>Network Visualization Module - Interactive map displaying the complete water network with layers for: confirmed infrastructure (solid lines), probabilistic infrastructure (gradient opacity based on confidence), sensor locations, active replacement zones, and water quality indicators. Users can filter by pipe material, age, condition, or priority score. 3D visualization mode shows depth and vertical connections.</li>
  <li>Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard - Live displays showing: current flow rates across the network, pressure readings with threshold alerts, leak detection events, sensor health status, and active field teams. Customizable widget layout allows operators to focus on their areas of responsibility.</li>
  <li>Mobile applications allow citizens to report water issues, view planned maintenance, access water quality data, and receive alerts about temporary service interruptions. Local water councils participate in replacement planning, ensuring vulnerable populations receive priority protection.</li>
</ul>
